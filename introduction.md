# Introduction to the Lineage Project

Ever wondered how Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolved from a mere concept to the transformative technology it is today? The Lineage project is here to take you on a journey through the rich history and development of AI, tracing its roots from the early days of symbolic reasoning to the cutting-edge advancements in machine learning and beyond.

## About Me

- I am Abdulhakeem Muhammed, the creator of the Lineage project. I started out as a Software Engineer with a passion for understanding and building systems that help solve real-world problems. Over time, my interest gravitated towards Artificial Intelligence, leading me to explore its vast landscape and the myriad of ideas that have shaped its evolution.
- My first encounter with AI was through basic machine learning algorithms and simple neural networks. But as someone who loves 'understanding the foundations' of knowledge, I found myself unable to fully appreciate the field without a deeper grasp of its history and the key concepts that have driven its progress. Why use 'this' model over 'that' one? What led to the development of certain architectures? What is the underlying algorithmic thinking behind these models?
- Again, I got involved with Data Engineering, Data Science, and AI Research. I was fortunate to work on various projects that allowed me to apply AI techniques in practical scenarios, including robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision. I researched and built an heuristic algorithms for solving optimization problems, which further fueled my curiosity about the theoretical underpinnings of AI.
- Afterwards, I found myself in the world of Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, I realized that many practitioners, including myself, often treated these models as black boxes without fully understanding their lineage and the foundational principles that underpin them.
- Lastly, I entered the world of Agentic AI using several frameworks and tools - and Model Context Protocol (MCP), to build autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks. This experience further highlighted the importance of understanding the historical context and evolution of AI to effectively leverage its capabilities.

## The Challenge

- With every new knowledge or field, I realized there's a growing disconnection between all of these fields. As an ML student, I was taught that ML is a subset of AI. It is a common knowledge that AI has both ML and Statisctics as its subsets. But how do these fields overlap? In what ways do they contribute to the overall development of AI? How do they differ from each other? These questions led me to write the first piece of an attempt to clarify these relationships in a LinkedIn post titled "Demystifying AI, ML, and Statistics: Understanding Their Interconnections". I tried to explain the differences between ML algorithms and Statistical algorithms, highlighting their unique characteristics and applications.
- However, I soon realized that as I delved deeper into the world of AI, this 'disconnection' only grew wider. Especially in the new and emerging fields of LLMs, RAG, and Agentic AI, where many concepts and techniques seemed to be presented without a clear understanding of their historical context or foundational principles. How they came to be, what contributed to their development and evolution over time, and how they are structured and built to 'sync' with the world of humans and business needs.
- This lack of lineage made it challenging to fully grasp the significance of these advancements and their implications for the future of AI.
- This also led to the notion that the field of Artificial Intelligence, expcially the emerging technologiesa around LLMs, RAG, and Agentic AI, is only for some 'selected chosen ones'. Advancements and breakthroughs are often presented as sudden leaps into the unknown, rather than as part of a continuous evolution of ideas and innovations. This perception can create barriers to entry for those who are interested in learning about AI but feel intimidated by its complexity and perceived exclusivity.
- Many Agentic AI or GenAI developers might not be grounded in the foundational fields of AI such as Classical AI, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Neural Networks. This lack of grounding can lead to a superficial understanding of the technologies they are working with, potentially resulting in suboptimal designs and implementations.
- Again, many upscaling and design patterns for building advanced AI system are now only being shared and directed by the 'selected few'. This I believe will not only create a 'diverse sets of standards' and monopoly of knowledge but will also stifle innovation and creativity in the field. AI is a field that thrives on collaboration and the exchange of ideas, and restricting access to advanced knowledge and techniques goes against the very spirit of scientific inquiry and progress.
- Most importantly, I felt that some foundational fields of AI (including Mathematicians, Statisticians, and Classical AI researchers) were being 'left out' of the conversation around the latest advancements in AI. Their contributions and insights are crucial for understanding the full scope of AI's evolution and for ensuring that new developments are built on a solid foundation of knowledge and expertise.

## Looking Forward

- To address these challenges, I embarked on the Lineage project with the goal of creating a comprehensive and structured reconstruction of the intellectual, mathematical, and engineering evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) from its inception to the present day.
- We want to build a 'support' for the human and business needs, NOT A REPLACEMENT.
- AI should be seen as an extension of human ingenuity and creativity, rather than a sudden leap into the unknown. This way AI will not be a 'replacement' for the human worker or thinker, but rather a powerful tool that enhances and amplifies human capabilities.
- By documenting the historical context and progression of AI, the Lineage project aims to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of this transformative technology.

## Conclusion

- Through the Lineage project, I hope to bridge the gap between the foundational fields of AI and the emerging technologies that are shaping its future. By providing a structured and detailed account of AI's lineage, I aim to empower researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to contribute to the field with a deeper understanding of its history and evolution.
- Ultimately, I believe that a comprehensive understanding of AI's lineage is essential for unlocking its full potential and ensuring that its development is guided by a rich legacy of knowledge and innovation.
- I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery as we unravel the fascinating history of Artificial Intelligence and chart a course for its future evolution.
