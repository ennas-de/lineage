# Introduction of Mathematics into Artificial Intelligence

This is the first real computational core of classical AI.

- In Section 1, we defined what `Intelligence` as the ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.

- We noted that `Symbolic Manipulation` is more crucial.

- Symbolism is:
  - the representation of the world,
  - encoding the associated rules, and
  - applying correct inference.
    <br> So, manipulating these resultant symbols create intelligence.

- We also touched a little on how we implemented intelligence at its barest minimum. In its purest form - in a feed forward loop, where the outcome of the last action of the agent on the environment afects the future outcome of the agent.

- In this Section 2, we will define how intelligence was implemented before learning existed using Mathematical formulations.

- At this stage in history:
  - There was no data
  - There was no learning
  - There was no parameters
  - Intelligence = explicit reasoning over explicitly defined spaces.

- Let us begin by looking at Section 1.1: Mathematical Representation of State.
