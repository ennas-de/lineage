# Chater 01: Classical (Old) Artificial Intelligence

We begin our journey at the origin.

Before neural networks, before machine learning, before large language models, there was **Classical AI** — often referred to as **Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI)**.

Classical AI represents the earliest systematic attempt to build machines that could _act intelligently_.

At its core was a simple ambition:

> Build machines that can make decisions under rules and constraints.

Humans have always sought automation — tools that reduce effort and increase efficiency. Classical AI extended automation beyond mechanical repetition. It aimed for **generalized automation**: systems that could choose actions depending on conditions.

The rise of programmable computers made this possible. Software engineering provided the mechanisms. Logic provided the structure. Formal rules provided the intelligence — or what appeared to be intelligence.

In this section, we examine how intelligence was first engineered using nothing more than conditionals, symbolic representations, and structured reasoning.

## Why Classical AI Matters

Modern AI systems may look radically different, but many of their core abstractions were born here:

- State
- Action
- Rule
- Goal
- Environment
- Agent

Even today, advanced agentic systems still rely on these same structural ideas.

To understand where AI is going, we must understand how it began.

## Scope of This Section

In this section, we will:

- Examine foundational software engineering principles that allowed systems to make conditional decisions
- Explore how early researchers first conceptualized intelligence
- Understand how “acting intelligently” was reduced to rule-based structure
- Simulate intelligence in its simplest engineered form

This is not yet learning.
It is not probability.
It is not neural computation.

It is intelligence as **explicit structure**.

### 1.1 Software Engineering Foundations

How conditionals (`if-then` logic) modeled _choice_ before intelligence was formally defined.

### 1.2 Genesis of AI

How and why intelligence became an engineering problem.

#### 1.2.1 What Artificial Intelligence Originally Meant

The early definition of intelligence as goal-directed behavior.

#### 1.2.2 Rational Agent vs Human-Like Agent

Two competing visions of intelligence — and why one dominated.

#### 1.2.3 The Environment-Agent Loop

The foundational abstraction that still survives in modern systems.

#### 1.2.4 Why Symbol Manipulation Was Enough (At First)

Why early AI believed reasoning over symbols could scale — and what limitations later emerged.

This section sets the intellectual foundation for everything that follows.

`Classical AI was not a failure.`
It was the first successful formalization of intelligence as structured action under constraints.

And from that framing, the entire lineage unfolds.
