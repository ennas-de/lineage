# Introduction

- Let us begin our journey into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - of the old. Classical AI, also known as the Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI), represents the early approaches to creating intelligent machines.

- As humans, we wanted to create things that could help us make better use of our time and resources. Think 'AUTOMATION' - but in a more generalized way - for machines.

- We needed machines that could perform in certain ways or act based on certain constraints.

- Hence, we strive to improve or update our conceptual Software Engineering mechanisms to create intelligent systems.

- Let us explore a little on some funcdamental principles in Software Engineering that we can leverage to create a seamingly 'intelligent system'. A system that can act or perform in a way that seems intelligent based on certain constraints or rules.

## Feed Forward

- We enter into the world of first directory: 1. Software Engineering.
