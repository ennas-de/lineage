# Section 01: Classical (aka Old) Artificial Intelligence

- Let us begin our journey into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - of the old. Classical AI, also known as the Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI), represents the early approaches to creating intelligent machines.

- As humans, we wanted to create things that could help us make better use of our time and resources. Think 'AUTOMATION' - but in a more generalized way - for machines.

- We needed machines that could perform in certain ways or act based on certain constraints.

- Hence, we strive to improve or update our conceptual Software Engineering mechanisms to create intelligent systems.

- Let us explore a little on some fundamental principles in Software Engineering that we can leverage to create a seamingly 'intelligent system'. A system that can act or perform in a way that seems intelligent based on certain constraints or rules.

## Scope

- In this Section we will dive into the basics of Software Engineering, where we will look how engineers build systems that can perform different actions under different conditions.
- We will also look at the genesis of Artificial Intelligence and how we first conceptualize intelligence.
- We will also try to simulate intelligence at its bares form.
